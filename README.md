# music-blog

For a range of personal and practical reasons (and since its so *easy*) I have decided to open this blog on music.  We'll see if it leads anywhere.

* [Lilypond]() is a variant of **Scheme** and a great programming language to learn and use.  
* There is the [Haskell School of Music](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/hudak/Papers/HSoM.pdf) 
* I do not have a music resource in `ML` in order to complete the trifecta

We can discuss all sorts of things from how music is written, to how it is interpreted and played, to how people enjoy it!
